# FriendRequestForm
Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to make a "Friend request form".

When completed, people will be able to fill out the form to request to be your friend. You can use their responses to decide if you want to be their friend. For example, I only want to be friends with people who watch Game of Thrones, so I could have a question in my form like:

Do you watch Game of Thrones?

O Yes .   O No .   O I might one day

You can decide what questions are on the form! Have fun with it, but there are some requirements:

Requirements:

   - Use Bootstrap v4 to construct the form. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/

- Implement a dropdown menu, a textarea, radio buttons, and checkboxes

- Implement a submit button (make sure to include type="submit")

- Make the form email yourself when it's submitted (hint: href="mailto:email@address.com")
